**MosaicX: A Framework for Implicit-Model Partitioning and Data-Driven Dimensional Analysis**

_MosaicX is an open framework that transforms complex physical models into patch atlas (piecewise interpretable structures). By combining Jacobian-based implicit-function evaluation, data-driven dimensional analysis, and graph-based knowledge aggregation, MosaicX enables scientists and engineers to:_

- **Partition** nonlinear systems into locally valid charts via Jacobian analysis.
- **Discover** unique and relevant dimensionless groups from multi-source data.
- **Fit** local explicit functions in stable regions, while flagging sensitive zones for experiments.
- **Aggregate** results into a knowledge graph that evolves with new data, supporting automated model revision.

👉 _From simple benchmarks (e.g., pendulum dynamics) to complex fluid–structure interactions, MosaicX aims to serve as a building block of the “machine scientist”: guiding experiments, repairing models, and stitching local insights into a global understanding._

🔮 Looking Ahead: Scaling and Self-Similarity

Inspired by Barenblatt’s Scaling, Self-Similarity, and Intermediate Asymptotics, I plan to integrate his framework of scaling laws and intermediate asymptotics into MosaicX. While Barenblatt’s work provides deep explanatory insight into how physical systems simplify through self-similarity, MosaicX offers an algorithmic pipeline to operationalize these ideas — automating variable partitioning, local invertibility checks, and uncertainty quantification.

This synergy will enable:

Automated discovery of scaling laws directly from experimental and simulation data.

Validation of self-similarity hypotheses using Jacobian-based partitioning and UQ.

Bridging theory and computation by embedding Barenblatt’s conceptual models into reproducible, data-driven workflows.

Ultimately, this integration aims to advance the vision of a Machine Scientist that unifies theoretical reasoning with computational automation.
